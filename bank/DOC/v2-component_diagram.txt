component diagram for the banking system that shows:
🏗️ Component Architecture Overview:
📱 External Interfaces Layer:

Mobile App, Web Portal, ATM Network - User-facing applications
Admin Panel - Management interface
Third Party Services - External integrations

🚪 Entry Layer:

Load Balancer - Distributes traffic across multiple instances
API Gateway - Single entry point for all API requests
Security Filter - Authentication and authorization

🎮 Presentation Layer (Controllers):

Account, Customer, Transaction Controllers - Handle HTTP requests
Auth, Employee, Report Controllers - Specialized endpoints
Notification Controller - Manages communication

🧠 Business Logic Layer:

Core Services - Main business operations
Specialized Services - Interest, fees, audit, risk, compliance
Factory Components - Create objects using factory pattern
Strategy Components - Interchangeable algorithms

💾 Data Access Layer:

Repository Layer - Standard CRUD operations
Custom Repositories - Complex queries and specifications
JPA Integration - Object-relational mapping

🏛️ Domain Model Layer:

Entity Hierarchies - Person, Account, Transaction inheritance
Security Entities - User, Role, Permission management
Value Objects - Immutable business data containers

🔒 Security Layer:

JWT Token Management - Authentication tokens
Authorization Services - Permission checking
User Details Service - Spring Security integration

🔧 Infrastructure Layer:

Databases - PostgreSQL primary, Redis cache
Message Queue - Asynchronous processing
Monitoring - Logging, metrics, health checks
Configuration - Environment-specific settings

⚡ Event Processing Layer:

Event Listeners - Handle domain events
Notification Observers - Observer pattern implementation
Message Brokers - Event distribution

🔄 Key Component Relationships:
Data Flow:

External requests → Load Balancer → API Gateway → Security Filter
Controllers receive filtered requests → call Services
Services implement business logic → access Repositories
Repositories interact with Database → return data
Events are published → processed by Listeners → trigger Actions

Cross-Cutting Concerns:

Security filters all requests and protects resources
Caching improves performance at service level
Logging & Monitoring tracks all component interactions
Event System enables loose coupling between components

Design Patterns Visible:

Layered Architecture - Clear separation of concerns
Factory Pattern - Object creation components
Strategy Pattern - Pluggable algorithms
Observer Pattern - Event-driven notifications
Repository Pattern - Data access abstraction

This component diagram provides a complete view of how all the code files we created fit together in the overall system architecture, showing both the static structure and the dynamic relationships between components.
