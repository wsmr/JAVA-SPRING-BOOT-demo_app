üöÄ Getting Started Steps:

Initialize Project:

bash   gradle init --type java-application
   # Or use Spring Initializr

Setup Database:

bash   ./scripts/database/init-db.sh

Configure Environment:

bash   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit with your configurations

Run Development:

bash   ./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev'

Access Application:

API: http://localhost:8080/api/v1
Swagger: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
Actuator: http://localhost:8080/actuator





üìù Development Best Practices:

Code Quality: Use SonarQube and Checkstyle
Testing: Maintain >80% test coverage
Documentation: Keep API docs updated
Git Flow: Feature branches with PR reviews
Security: Regular dependency updates
Performance: Regular load testing
Monitoring: Set up alerts and dashboards

This structure follows industry best practices and can scale from a small application to an enterprise-level banking system. Each layer is properly separated, making it maintainable, testable, and extensible!
