this enhanced design incorporates all OOP concepts and design patterns:



üèóÔ∏è 1. ENCAPSULATION (Data Hiding & Protection)
Improved Access Modifiers:

- (private): bankId, employeeId - only the class itself can access
# (protected): personId, accountId - subclasses can access
+ (public): Methods like getBalance(), deposit() - anyone can access

Example:
javaclass Account {
    #balance: Double  // Protected - subclasses can access
    -accountId: String  // Private - only Account class can access
    +getBalance(): Double  // Public - anyone can call this
}



üß¨ 2. INHERITANCE (IS-A Relationships)
Enhanced Hierarchy:

Person ‚Üí Customer, BankEmployee
BankEmployee ‚Üí Teller, BranchManager, LoanOfficer
Account ‚Üí SavingsAccount, CheckingAccount, BusinessAccount
Transaction ‚Üí DepositTransaction, WithdrawalTransaction, TransferTransaction

Benefits:

Code reuse (all employees share common properties)
Polymorphic behavior (treat all employees the same way)



üé≠ 3. POLYMORPHISM (Many Forms)
Method Overriding (marked with *):
java// Base class
abstract class Account {
    abstract withdraw(amount: Double): TransactionResult*
}

// Different implementations
class SavingsAccount {
    withdraw(amount: Double): TransactionResult  // Checks withdrawal limits
}

class CheckingAccount {
    withdraw(amount: Double): TransactionResult  // Allows overdraft
}
Interface Implementation:

Multiple classes implement ITransactionProcessor differently
All notification types implement INotificationObserver




üé® 4. ABSTRACTION (Hide Complexity)
Abstract Classes:

Person: Can't create a generic person, must be Customer or Employee
Account: Must be a specific account type
Transaction: Must be a specific transaction type

Interfaces:

ITransactionProcessor: Defines what transaction processing should do
INotificationService: Defines notification contract
IAuthenticationService: Defines security contract






üèóÔ∏è Design Patterns Used:

1. Singleton Pattern (Bank Class)
javaclass Bank {
    -instance: Bank
    -Bank()  // Private constructor
    +getInstance(): Bank  // Only one bank instance
}

2. Strategy Pattern (Interest & Fee Calculation)

Different algorithms for calculating interest
Can switch between simple and compound interest
Different fee structures for different account types

3. Observer Pattern (Notifications)

When transaction happens, all notification services get notified
Email, SMS, Push notifications can all listen for events

4. Command Pattern (Transactions)

Each transaction is a command that can be executed and undone
Supports transaction rollback and audit trails

5. Factory Pattern (Account Creation)

Different factories create different account types
Centralizes account creation logic







üîí Additional Improvements:
1. Security & Authentication:

IAuthenticationService for login/authorization
Permission-based access control
Session management

2. Value Objects:

Address, ContactInfo - immutable data containers
TransactionResult - standardized return type

3. Better Error Handling:

TransactionResult instead of simple boolean
Status enums for better state management

4. Audit Trail:

All transactions maintain audit information
Better compliance and debugging

5. Extensibility:

Easy to add new account types
New transaction types can be added
New notification methods can be plugged in





üéØ Key OOP Benefits Achieved:

Maintainability: Changes to one class don't affect others
Reusability: Common functionality shared through inheritance
Flexibility: New features can be added without breaking existing code
Testability: Each component can be tested independently
Scalability: System can grow without major restructuring

This enhanced design follows SOLID principles, uses proven design patterns, and provides a robust foundation for a real banking system!
