This component diagram represents your banking system organized into logical layers and components based on your class diagram. Here's how it maps to your original classes and follows good architectural principles:
Component Organization:
Presentation Layer:

Handles different user interfaces (Web, Mobile, ATM)
Maps to how customers and staff would interact with the system

Service Layer:

Contains business services that orchestrate operations
Bank Management Service: Handles Bank and Branch operations
Customer Service: Manages Customer lifecycle and relationships
Account Service: Handles Account operations (SavingsAccount, CheckingAccount)
Transaction Service: Processes all Transaction types
Staff Service: Manages BankStaff operations

Core Business Layer:

Contains the core domain logic from your class diagram
Implements the business rules for Bank, Branch, Account, and Transaction entities

Data Layer:

Repository pattern for data persistence
Each major entity has its own repository component

Shared Components:

Cross-cutting concerns like authentication, audit, validation
Configuration management for system settings

External Systems:

Integration points for payment processing, credit checks, regulatory reporting, and notifications

Key Design Principles:

Separation of Concerns: Each layer has distinct responsibilities
Dependency Direction: Higher layers depend on lower layers
Interface-based: Components interact through well-defined interfaces
Scalability: Services can be independently scaled and deployed
Maintainability: Changes in one component have minimal impact on others

This component structure would support a microservices architecture if needed, or can work as a modular monolith.
